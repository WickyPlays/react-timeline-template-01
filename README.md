## Introduction
Hello, Wicky here! Welcome to my Timeline template app #01, made with ReactJS, featuring cool style timeline format, and even users who don't know coding can use this easily too via `Timelines.js`! 

## Featuring
+ Title, description of timeline node
+ Priority assignment (icon, text)
+ Date (yyyy/mm/dd) format to denote which date the timeline node occured
+ A cool Timeline tree view (thanks to [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/))
+ Context section (hidden behind timeline node)
+ A non-coder friendly format to easily add timeline without coding or JSON (maybe a bit of it, but it's easy to understand). Just use a few tags and done

## Demo
The demo of the project can be found here http://localhost:3000/react-timeline-template-01

## How to use
In this tutorial, we prefer you to use Git to clone the app to yours.
1. Download Git into your desktop and clone it to your directory via `git clone <url of this repo>`
	If you don't want to use Git, just download the ZIP source code from the green button which says "Code".
2. Setup the code which you just downloaded by initializing `npm install` on the directory of the downloaded code (Please install Node.js first!!).
3. Change the priority tag based on your need in `Constants.js`. The example should tell you the format you need to change. Get the icons easily via https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/
4. Follow the example of what's in `Timelines.js` and modify it with your favorite (or hate) event log. Format of the date should be year first, month second then day after.
5. To run the app, use `npm start`.
6. That's it!
